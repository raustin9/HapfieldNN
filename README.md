# Hapfield Network
This is an implementation of a Hopfeld neural network in C++.

## Running the test program
To compile and run, use the command `make all` or `make`. If you want to compile and run, you can use `make run`.

To run the program on its own, you need to set the flags `./bin -P [number of vectors], -N [number of neurons] --num-experiments [number of experiments'`

Running `make run` will fill these flags to the defaults of 50, 100, and 5 as the lab specifies.
